# Offshore-Wind-Maintenance-Health
Renewable energy solutions offer a wide array of advantages such as energy safety or
environmental benefits and are therefore increasingly expanding around the world. The
number of offshore wind farms has been growing particularly in recent years, with newly
constructed projects getting progressively larger and being further developed off shore.
These harsher conditions cause wind farms to break at a higher rate, resulting in personnel
having to perform maintenance operation work more frequently. However, the conditions
off shore constitute a challenging environment for operations, especially due to the high
wind speeds when working in heights as well as the high waves in the open sea. As a
result, the number of offshore wind maintenance safety incidents is alarmingly high, with
the industry amounting to an injury rate up to four times higher than offshore oil or gas.
In order to alleviate these lasting issues, this project provides an artifact for evaluating
the weather conditions at the worldâ€™s major wind offshore sites upon request. The artifact
utilizes two different APIs for fetching relevant wind speed and wave height data to give
a precise recommendation of whether it is safe to carry out maintenance operations at
a specific location. Additionally, the artifact provides a 24-hour forecast of these two
metrics to facilitate future scheduling operations. However, while the application covers
most functional requirements expected of such a system, externally given limitations such
as budget or time constraints complicate the implementation of reliability or scalability
features. Therefore, this system must be seen as a first step towards a holistic offshore wind
weather condition warning app that will improve through iterations over time.
